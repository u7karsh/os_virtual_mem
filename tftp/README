# Place these files in directory /srv/tftp on the Linux VM used
# for development.  Then read the following and copy this file
# into place.
#
# To make grub work, configure a DHCP server and place a copy
# of this file in:
#
#	/etc/dhcp.conf
#
# The idea is that when a VM starts, it uses PXE boot to get a
# DHCP address, and is given the file name "xinu.grub" as part
# of the DCHP response.  The PXE boot process downloads and
# runs the file, which contains the grub program with a built-in
# startup script.  The script specifies that grub should download
# and run file xinu.boot (from the same TFTP server that was used
# for the PCE boot).  Xinu is placed in file xinu.boot, which means
# grub will start Xinu.
#
# You may delete this commentary or leave it because DHCP
# will ignore lines that start with pound sign and blank
# lines.
